## Project Concept
Across the past month, the four of us have explored the world of creativity and the countless factors that motivate it. Through a collection of five photos, explore what we've learnt about how YOU can live a more fulfilling creative life. Many may think creativity comes and goes like a muse, but in reality we have the power to control its otherwordly abilities through nature, incubation and intrinsic drive.
